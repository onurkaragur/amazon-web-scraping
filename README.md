This project is a simple Amazon Price Tracker that scrapes product details and tracks price changes for a given item on Amazon. It periodically checks the price and logs it into a CSV file. If the price drops below a specified threshold, it sends an email notification to the user.

IMPORTANT: Error in the code is solely due to E-mail parts not being filled in.
